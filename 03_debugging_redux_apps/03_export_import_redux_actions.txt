Export and import actions with Redux Dev Tools

1. On redux dev tools window we can use the "Export to a file" button to export all our actions to a json file

2. For import a json file of actions we have a button "import from a file".

This is very ppowerful and useful to share our actions and maybe replicate some actions or steps with more details.
With this tools we can do every change or debbug the project in a easier way.
