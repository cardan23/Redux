Tracing with Redux Dev Tools

1. Install redux dev tool npm package like this:
    npm i redux-devtools-extension

2. With this package installed we can use now "redux-devtools-extension" into our project, so we will made some changes into
our store configuration.

intead having this way..


const store = createStore(
    reducer,
    window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
    );



we will replace "window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()" parameter with
"devToolsEnhancer({trace: true})".

3. Add "devtool: source-map" to webpack config and  restart development server, stop the server and then execute something
like this: npm start

4. After this, on Settings tag on devTools from google chrome redux dev tools we need to click.

5. fill the editor to be able to trace the application in our case will be "vscode"

6. Set the absolute path of the project and save changes.

7. After this we will be able to check and trace our dispatch events into visual code (or the code editor you prefer)
