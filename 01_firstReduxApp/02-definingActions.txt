Designing the actions

An actions is just a plain javascript object that describes what just happended.

As second step of the project we need to desing or define the actions.

we can do next actions

Add a bug
Mark as resolved
delete a bug

I real world applications we can add a lot of actions like order the list of book objects, 
filter a list of book objects, etc.  For now we can do
just those three actions to basic and better understanding.


Example of an action:

{
    type: "bugAdded",
    description: ""
}

Redux is inspired into "flux" library wich is like Redux, so in flux we use the action like this:

{
    type: "bugRemoved",
    payload:{
        id: 1
    }
}

As you can see we a have a payload object so, we are going to use this object to have a better way to structure our action
this is not a requirement, just a recomendation.
