Designing the Store

At the begining of the project we need to desing or define the structure of the Store.
In this case will be a list of books with next structure.

[
    {
        id: 1,
        description: "",
        resolved: false
    },
    { ... },
    { ... }
]

this is only the example for the exercise and try to understand how it works.

In real life we can see some store object like this...

{
    bugs: [
        {
            id: 1,
            description: "",
            resolved: false
        }
    ],
    currentUser: {}
}

but we can see this later on the course, for now lets keep first version.
