Explaining redux first time with my own words and my undertandings

	1.Redux is a container where we can store varibles used into javascript and is very useful to access this content 
	without going back end and check. We have some stept intermediate to access this and check values.
	
	Is like a database for front end, with this we can know the next things:
	
	Suposse we change a value in UI, with redux we can know.... "how/why/when/where" changed this value.
	
	
	Example
		A clear example is when we need to update a value into the UI and we need to have sync this value
		with other parts in UI, in this case we can make a call to backend and update all parts of the code probably causing
		some discrepancies. But with Redux we can avoid this problem and have all elements in sync with same changes in all parts.


	Some descriptions of Redux

	1. Redux centralizes application's state
	2. Makes data flow transparent and predictable
